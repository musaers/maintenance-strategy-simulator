# Component Degradation Simulator

A Python-based simulation tool for modeling component degradation and maintenance strategies in complex systems. This application helps engineers and maintenance planners visualize degradation patterns, compare maintenance policies, and optimize cost-effectiveness.


## Features

- **Component-specific Modeling**: Simulate degradation of multiple components with individually customizable parameters (failure thresholds, degradation probabilities, and costs)
- **Interactive Visualizations**: 
  - Time series plots showing degradation level of each component
  - Heatmap visualization of system state over time
  - Cost breakdown and cumulative cost analysis
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Uptime percentage
  - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
  - Maintenance efficiency
  - False alarm rate
  - Comprehensive cost analysis
- **Cost Optimization**: Analyze the cost implications of different maintenance strategies, including component replacement, labor, inspection, and failure costs

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Dependencies
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tkinter (usually comes with Python installation)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/component-degradation-simulator.git
cd component-degradation-simulator
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Application
Execute the main Python script:
```bash
python degradation_simulator.py
```

### Interface Guide

1. **Simulation Parameters**:
   - Set the number of components
   - Configure default failure threshold and degradation probability
   - Specify simulation duration (steps)

2. **Component-specific Parameters**:
   - Click "Edit Component Parameters" to customize each component
   - Set unique names, failure thresholds, degradation probabilities, and costs

3. **Cost Parameters**:
   - Maintenance labor costs
   - Failure costs (downtime, etc.)
   - Inspection costs

4. **Running Simulations**:
   - Click "Run Simulation" to execute the model
   - Review results in the visualization tabs

5. **Analyzing Results**:
   - Time Series tab: View degradation patterns of each component
   - Component Heatmap tab: Visualize degradation levels across all components
   - Cost Analysis tab: Examine cost breakdown and cumulative costs

## Theory and Background

The simulation is based on the following key concepts:

- **Component Degradation**: Components degrade stochastically according to individual probabilities
- **Failure Threshold**: Each component has a specific threshold at which it is considered failed
- **System State**:
  - Green (0): All components operational
  - Yellow (1): At least one component degraded but none failed
  - Red (2): At least one component failed
- **Maintenance Action**: When a failure is detected, all components are restored to their initial state

## Examples

The simulator can be used for various scenarios including:

- Evaluating the effectiveness of different maintenance policies
- Analyzing the cost-benefit ratio of preventive vs. corrective maintenance
- Determining optimal inspection intervals
- Estimating spare parts requirements
- Visualizing degradation patterns in complex multi-component systems
